#
# == Class: monit
#
# Monit class installs and configures local server server monitoring using 
# monit. It includes defines that allow other modules to add monit rule 
# fragments.
#
# Note that this module depends on "puppetlabs/stdlib" module and if 
# $bind_address is set to 'query', on the 'getip.sh' script working properly on 
# the Puppet master.
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*ensure*]
#   Status of monit and it's configurations. Valid values are 'present' 
#   (default), 'absent' and 'running'. The value 'running' does the same as 
#   'present', but additionally ensures that the monit service is running.
# [*bind_address*]
#   The IP-address/hostname monit's web server will bind to. Use special value 
#   'all' to bind to all available interfaces. If this is set to 'query', bind 
#   to the IP that's returned by querying the DNS on Puppetmaster using this 
#   node's $::fqdn. This can be useful if $:fqdn resolves to a private IP and 
#   you want to allow access to monit webserver from the intranet, but not from 
#   the Internet. Default value for this parameter is 'localhost'.
# [*bind_port*]
#   The port monit's web server will bind to. Defaults to 2812.
# [*username*]
#   Username for accessing the webserver. Can be omitted (default).
# [*password*]
#   Password for accessing the webserver. Can be omitted (default).
# [*allow_addresses_ipv4*]
#   An array containing IP-addresses and subnets that are allowed to access 
#   monit's built-in webserver. The address limitations are enforced in 
#   webserver configuration and packet filtering rules (if in use). The default 
#   value is ['127.0.0.1']. Note that $mmonit_host (if defined) is automatically 
#   added to this array.
# [*loadavg_1min*]
#   Notify if one minute load average rises below this threshold. Defaults to 20.
# [*loadavg_5min*]
#   Notify if five minute load average rises below this threshold. Defaults to 10.
# [*memory_usage*]
#   Notify if memory usage exceeds this percentage. Defaults to '95%'.
# [*cpu_usage_system*]
#   Notify if kernel-space CPU usage exceeds this percentage. Defaults to '95%'.
# [*cpu_usage_user*]
#   Notify if user-space CPU usage exceeds this percentage. Defaults to '95%'.
# [*space_usage*]
#   Notify if disk space usage (on root filesystem) exceeds this percentage. 
#   Defaults to '90%'.
# [*email*]
#   Email where monit notifications/alerts are sent. Defaults to variable 
#   $::servermonitor defined in the node definition/site.pp.
# [*mmonit_user*]
#   Username for the M/Monit daemon. Omit if you don't use M/Monit.
# [*mmonit_password*]
#   Password for the M/Monit daemon. Omit if you don't use M/Monit.
# [*mmonit_host*]
#   Hostname or IP-address of the M/Monit daemon. Omit if you don't use M/Monit.
# [*mmonit_port*]
#   Port on which the M/Monit service listens. Defaults to 8080. Omit if you 
#   don't use M/Monit.
# [*filesystems*]
#   A hash of monit::filesystem defined resources to realize.

#   email => 'john.doe@domain.com',
